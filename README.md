# NetSim
Broad-cast Network Simulation in Delphi

This project has been created as an experiment of simulating network communication with broad-cast.

A communication chanel is a file, to which all client write and read.
There is always a moderator on the chanel.


## ABSTRACT
### ASPECTS IN MODELLING COMPUTER COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

When the first computer networks were compiled, attention was paid primarily to hardware, but the software part had been left for future. 
Such a strategy does not work any more. Time and experience have proven that the efficiency of data transportation depends at first up on the algorithms (protocols) being used. Either the data is being transported through wires or wireless, at either 1000km or 10m, even if in the communication process take part only two machines or more of them, for each of the situations there can be achieved more algorithms that would accomplish the task, but the problem is to find the best one.
Therefore, for each certain real life situation encountered so far there exist specific protocols that are best given to it.

Given the general features, there are two types of technologies for data transmission:
—	broadcast networks 
—	point-to-point networks 

The main problems with broadcast networks are solving the conflict for "conquering" the channel and efficient use of time.
Point-to-point networks are based on algorithms for finding the shortest path from transmitter to the recipient.
